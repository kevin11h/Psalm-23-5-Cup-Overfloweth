1
A psalm of David.

I
The LORD is my shepherd;*

there is nothing I lack.a

2
In green pastures he makes me lie down;

to still waters he leads me;

3
bhe restores my soul.

He guides me along right paths*

for the sake of his name.

4
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,c

I will fear no evil, for you are with me;

your rod and your staff comfort me.

II
5
*You set a table before me

in front of my enemies;*

You anoint my head with oil;*d

my cup overflows.e
